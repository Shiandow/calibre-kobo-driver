# Kobo KePub Plugins

![CI](https://github.com/jgoguen/calibre-kobo-driver/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This provides a series of [calibre][calibre] extensions enabling calibre to work
with ePub files with Kobo's additional features (called **KePub**). The
following plugins are provided:

- `KoboTouchExtended`: This is a device driver plugin extending the
  functionality of the existing KoboTouch driver provided with Calibre to
  enable extra Kobo features. **Please note**: modified books are not saved
  back into your Calibre library to prevent issues with overwriting library
  configurations unexpectedly, so books are processed in transit to your device
  every time. In most cases, the extra time required should not be noticeable.
- `KePub Output`: This is a conversion plugin allowing calibre to convert any
  supported input format to KePub.
- `KePub Metadata Writer`: This is a metadata plugin which supports the
  `KePub Output` plugin. Installing this plugin allows calibre to write KePub
  metadata to the book as it is written out in calibre's conversion process. It
  serves no purpose without the `KePub Output` plugin.
- `KePub Input`: This is a conversion plugin allowing calibre to convert KePub
  to any supported output format.
- `KePub Metadata Reader`: This is a metadata plugin which allows calibre to
  read KePub metadata when converting a book from KePub format. It currently
  serves no purpose without the `KePub Input` plugin.

**WARNING: THE KEPUB FILE STRUCTURE IS NOT YET FULLY UNDERSTOOD. DO NOT, UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DELETE THE FILES FOR THE SOURCE FORMAT. ALWAYS HAVE A
NON-KEPUB FORMAT FOR YOUR BOOKS.**

## Installation

The current release version of this plugin may be installed directly within
calibre:

1. Open calibre's preferences, choose `Plugins`, and click `Get new plugins`
1. Select the name of the plugin(s) you want to install from the list of
   available plugins and click `Install`
    1. Don't see it? You may already have it installed. Restart calibre and see
       if you are notified of a pending update.
    1. If you want to install multiple plugins, you must select and install
       them one at a time. Calibre will ask you to restart after each one, but
       you can safely wait until all desired plugins have been installed to
       restart calibre.
1. Restart calibre

## Download

To download this plugin, either clone the repository or download a snapshot. It
is not necessary to download this plugin in this way unless you want to install
from source for some reason, such as plugin development.

### Install from source

Please note, installation from source is only supported on Linux and Mac OS X
10.11 and later. Simply run the `create-plugin.sh` script to generate the ZIP
file package for all plugins.

Windows users can run the `create-plugin.ps1` script, which requires that
PowerShell allow running unsigned scripts (which is not the default setting and
is dangerous to leave enabled). This PowerShell script is not regularly tested
and is wholly unsupported; if it does not work for you and you know how to fix
it, please submit a bug report with a patch or a corrected PowerShell script.
Any bug reports for the PowerShell script which do not include a patch and a
description of what problem is solved will be ignored.

Add the resulting ZIP file to calibre:

1. `Preferences`
1. `Plugins`
1. `Load plugin from file`

## Usage

To use the device driver plugin after installing:

1. Connect your supported Kobo device and wait for it to be detected by calibre
1. Select the book(s) you want to send to your device.
1. Click the **Send to device** button.

To use the conversion output format plugin after installing:

1. Choose the book you want to convert to KePub format
1. Choose the **KEPUB** format from the list of output formats (top-right of
   the conversion window)
1. Choose **KePub Options** from the left menu and make your option selections
1. Click **OK**

**WARNING: THE KEPUB FILE STRUCTURE IS NOT YET FULLY UNDERSTOOD. DO NOT, UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, DELETE THE FILES FOR THE SOURCE FORMAT. ALWAYS HAVE A
NON-KEPUB FORMAT FOR YOUR BOOKS.**

To use the conversion input format plugin after installing:

1. Choose the KePub book you want to convert to a different format
1. Choose the desired target format from the list of output formats (top-right
   of the conversion window)
1. Click **OK**

### Special Note

It is recommended that you disable the built-in KoboTouch driver (authored by
David Forrester) while this plugin is installed. On rare occasions, calibre may
inadvertently select the built-in KoboTouch driver instead of this plugin.  But
do not disable the built-in Kobo driver.

### Adding Arbitrary CSS

The device driver plugin, through the base KoboTouch driver provided with
calibre, has the ability to copy all rules from a specific CSS file into each
book as it is uploaded. To support easily maintaining device-specific CSS files,
the device driver can copy a CSS file into the correct place to allow adding it
to each book. To do this, locate the calibre plugin directory, create a CSS file
in there, and ensure that the **Modify CSS** option is selected in the driver
preferences. To locate the calibre plugin directory, open calibre's preferences,
choose **Miscellaneous**, and click the **Open calibre configuration directory**
button. The plugin directory is in there.

The name of the CSS file must be in the format `kobo_extra_<DEVICE>.css`. The
following replacements for `<DEVICE>` are currently supported (capitalization
is important):

- Kobo Aura H2O &mdash; AURAH2O (`kobo_extra_AURAH2O.css`)
- Kobo Aura HD &mdash; AURAHD (`kobo_extra_AURAHD.css`)
- Kobo Aura &mdash; AURA (`kobo_extra_AURA.css`)
- Kobo Clara &mdash; CLARA (`kobo_extra_CLARA.css`)
- Kobo Forma &mdash; FORMA (`kobo_extra_FORMA.css`)
- Kobo Glo &mdash; GLO (`kobo_extra_GLO.css`)
- Kobo Glo HD &mdash; GLOHD (`kobo_extra_GLOHD.css`)
- Kobo Libra &mdash; LIBRA (`kobo_extra_LIBRA.css`)
- Kobo Mini &mdash; MINI (`kobo_extra_MINI.css`)
- Kobo Touch &mdash; TOUCH (`kobo_extra_TOUCH.css`)

Please note, this will blindly overwrite any `kobo_extra.css` you may have
already sent to your Kobo device! If you have created the `kobo_extra.css` file
on your Kobo device already and you want to make use of this feature, you must
copy `kobo_extra.css` to the location specified above.

Please also be aware that support for some Kobo devices (e.g. the Aura H2O,
Libra, Forma, etc.) was only added in later calibre versions than the minimum
required for this plugin. Accordingly, you'll need to be running the appropriate
minimum calibre version for this feature to work for all devices.

### Hyphenation

The driver plugin and the conversion output plugin includes the ability to add
a CSS file to each book enabling KePub hyphenation. The standard hyphenation
dictionaries provided on Kobo devices are somewhat deficient for some languages;
fixing this (or adding your own dictionary) requires a little work and requires
that you can create gzipped tarballs (.tgz files). Note that you can only
update existing dictionaries, you cannot add new ones.

1. Somewhere on your computer, create the directory structure
   `usr/local/Kobo/hyphenDicts` (capitalization is important)
1. Download the LibreOffice hyphenation dictionary for your language
    1. This will be a file with the `oxt` extension. This is just a ZIP archive
       with a different name.
1. Unzip the OXT file (Windows users need to rename the file to change the
   extension to `zip`, which requires Explorer to be configured to
   [show file extensions][winshowext], which is a good idea to do anyway) and
   look for the file named as `hyph_[language].dic`.
1. Copy the hyphenation dictionary to the `hyphenDicts` folder without changing
   the name.
1. Add the `usr` folder to `KoboRoot.tgz`
    1. UNIX users (Linux, Solaris, BSD, Mac, etc.) can, from a terminal window,
       run `tar czf KoboRoot.tgz usr/` from wherever you put the `usr` directory.
    1. Windows users, you're on your own. It has been reported that using the
       free [7-Zip archiver][7zip] you can create .tgz files. See
       [this article][wintargz] for more details.
        1. If you follow these directions exactly, your file will have the
           extension `.tar.gz`. You can safely rename this to `.tgz` after the
           file has been created and ignore the Windows warning about changing
           file extensions.

Once you have created `KoboRoot.tgz` copy it to the `.kobo` directory on your
Kobo device, unmount/eject the drive, and unplug the device. You will see a
screen indicating that the Kobo device is updating; it is not, but this method
takes advantage of the Kobo update mechanism to load the necessary dictionary
files and the Kobo device cannot distinguish between this and a real software
update. Make sure you keep your version of `KoboRoot.tgz` around, you will need
to re-apply it after every Kobo software update!

Provided languages are:

1. U.S. English (en\_US)
2. French (fr\_FR)
3. Spanish (es\_ES)
4. German (de\_DE)
5. Italian (it\_IT)
6. Portugese (pt\_PT)
7. Dutch (nl\_NL)

Please note that even with this feature, hyphenation is not exact. Also remember
that you can only update existing dictionaries.

### Kobo JavaScript Extraction

Both the driver and conversion output plugins include the ability to extract the
Kobo JavaScript file from a free Kobo-supplied KePub which is not encumbered by
any Digital Restrictions Management (DRM). To avoid distributing any of Kobo's
copyrighted work, enabling this requires a little work:

1. Obtain a KePub file from Kobo which is provided to you without any Digital
   Restrictions Management.
    1. Some of [Kobo's free eBooks][kobofreebooks] are provided without DRM.
    2. In some regions, Kobo devices are sold with free ebooks in the
       `.kobo/kepub/` folder on the device which do not have DRM.
1. Copy the KePub file to the calibre plugins directory
    1. To find the plugins directory, open calibre's preferences, choose
       **Miscellaneous**, and click **Open calibre configuration directory**
    1. Go to the **plugins** directory
1. Rename the KePub file to `reference.kepub.epub`
    1. Windows users must be sure to
       [show file extensions in Windows Explorer][winshowext] to be able to
       properly rename the file.

Once this file is in place and correctly named, the driver and conversion output
plugins will automatically extract the Kobo JavaScript file, add it to books
during conversion, and add appropriate references to content files.

### Generated KePub File Copying

On occasion, such as for debugging purposes, you may wish to have easy access
to the generated KePub file. There is an option in the device driver plugin
which allows you to enter the full, absolute path to a directory where all
generated files will be copied to once they have been converted. This directory
must:

1. Be somewhere you can write to
1. Contain no variables
    1. OS X and Linux users may use a tilde (~) to refer to their home directory
       instead of typing it in full (/home/jgoguen/calibre-debug may be entered
       as ~/calibre-debug). Windows users must always enter a full path.

The final path will be a combination of this path and the save template for the
plugin. If your debug path is `/home/jgoguen/calibre-debug` and your save
template is `{author_sort}/{title}` then a KePub file would be copied to, for
example, `/home/jgoguen/calibre-debug/Camerata, Jo/A History of Vanguard
Industries.kepub.epub`. Directories will be created as needed.

## Contributing

Decided you want to contribute to the development of these plugins? Awesome!
You have many options:

1. **Contribute code**, whether for existing bug reports, for new bugs that you
   found, or for new features that you really want to see implemented. To
   contribute code, you may fork the repository and send a Github pull request,
   or you may send me a PM on MobileRead with a git patch file.
2. **Submit bug reports**. Bug reports are my to-do list for this plugin; any
   requests anywhere else are likely to get missed and forgotten and direct
   emails **will be silently ignored**. Although I'm happy to discuss the
   plugins on the MobileRead forums, I may still ask you to create a bug report;
   this is so I actually remember to investigate your request!
3. **Test pre-released code** from Github. Between releases, new code is
   committed to the Github repository and may be installed using directions
   provided in this file. Based on your testing, you may submit bug reports,
   provide feedback, think of new feature requests, or just generally enjoy
   early access (and not necessarily stable code!) to upcoming versions of the
   plugin.

You may also prefer to contribute in some other way. You may contribute by
answering questions from other people who may have issues, purchasing items
from my wishlists (not yet linked, I'll get on that soon-ish), continuing to use
this plugin and providing feedback, assisting with purchasing new Kobo readers
for continued testing, and probably a few other ways I haven't thought of yet.

## Reporting a Bug

Found a bug with this plugin? Great! I want to hear from you! Go to
[GitHub and submit a new bug report](https://github.com/jgoguen/calibre-kobo-driver/issues/new).
Under no circumstances should I be emailed directly unless I have asked to have
something sent to me. Any emails I haven't asked for **may be silently ignored**
at my sole discretion. Everyone can benefit from a public bug tracker, but only
one person benefits from a private email.

When submitting a bug, I require the following information as a minimum, but
any additional information is good to include:

1. What version of calibre and plugin you are using. If you are not on the
   latest plugin version, I will require that you update before I accept any
   bug report. If you are not on the latest version of calibre, I may not be
   able to reproduce the issue and may ask you to install multiple test versions
   and provide debug logging.
2. The full error message reported by calibre, if any.
3. For issues processing books, whether or not you have a book that you are
   able to send me that demonstrates the issue. DO NOT UPLOAD EBOOK FILES TO
   THE ISSUE TRACKER! Under no circumstances should copyrighted content be
   uploaded to a public bug. If a book file is needed, I will send you a link
   to use to upload one.
4. The calibre debug log. No bug is accepted without this provided.
    1. To get the calibre debug log, click the arrow beside the "Preferences"
       menu, choose "Restart in debug mode", repeat the same action that caused
       the issue, and close calibre. The debug log will be automatically
       displayed to you.

## Known Issues

When using Kobo firmware 2.9.0 or later, sideloaded KePub files do not display
full in-book statistics available on official book files.

If you have previously installed the device driver plugin in calibre 0.9.18 or
earlier, then you upgrade to calibre 0.9.19 or later and can't update the
plugin or install the conversion output format plugin, you must manually
replace the device driver plugin ZIP file:

1. Download the latest version of the code.
1. Generate a new plugin ZIP file.
1. Shut down calibre entirely.
1. Open the calibre plugin directory.
    1. Don't know where this is? Before you close calibre, open calibre's
       preferences, choose **Miscellaneous**, and click the **Open calibre
       configuration directory** button. The plugin directory is in there.
1. Replace the file named **KoboTouchExtended.zip** with the new version you
   created. Please make sure the file name remains the same.

If you get an error similar to the following:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "site-packages\calibre\gui2\preferences\plugins.py", line 310, in add_plugin
    File "site-packages\calibre\customize\ui.py", line 361, in add_plugin
    File "site-packages\calibre\customize\ui.py", line 53, in load_plugin
    File "site-packages\calibre\customize\zipplugin.py", line 169, in load
    File "importlib__init__.py", line 37, in import_module
    File "site-packages\calibre\customize\zipplugin.py", line 147, in load_module
    File "calibre_plugins.kobotouch_extended.__init__", line 4
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

The solution is to go back to the top of this file and read it again.

In some circumstances people have reported that while reading a book uploaded
with this plugin they suddenly realize that a large amount of time (two hours
or more) has passed without their awareness of the passage of time. The only
known solution is to finish reading your current book. Voracious readers tend
to report this issue more frequently. Please note, sleep is only a temporary
resolution.
